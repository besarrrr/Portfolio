          <p>
          I am currently in full-stack software
        engineering bootcamp through the University of Texas at Austin and I am currently open for work. I am excited about applying what I have
        learned in the class room in a real world setting. In any role, I look for an environment that is collaborative and fosters continual learning. I am
        looking to learn more in a diverse technology ecosystem within a highly collaborative applications development
        team. I am an ambitious problem solver leveraging a background in customer service to
        deliver client satisfaction through leadership and technical know-how.
